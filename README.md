track-communities
=================
This analytic first assigns relationships between tracks based on a configuarable definition of geo-temporal co-occurrence.  It then runs [Distributed Louvain Modularity](http://sotera.github.io/distributed-louvain-modularity/) on the aggregated network of track relationships to allow user analysis of track communities.

This project also provides a web-based analysis tool to assist in this analysis.
