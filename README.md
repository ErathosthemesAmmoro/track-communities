Track Communities
===================
This analytic assigns relationships between tracks based on (a configurable definition of) geospatial and temporal co-occurrence.

It then runs [Distributed Louvain Modularity](http://sotera.github.io/distributed-louvain-modularity/) on the aggregated network of constructed relationships to allow analysis of tracks within communities.  A web-based tool is provided to browse the networks of communities, view them on a map, and observe co-location highlights within a dynamic graph.
