Track Communities
===================
This analytic assigns relationships between tracks based on a configurable definition of geospatial and temporal co-occurrence.  

It then runs [Distributed Louvain Modularity](http://sotera.github.io/distributed-louvain-modularity/) on the aggregated network of constructed relationships to allow user analysis of tracks within communities.  A web-based tool is provided to browse the networks of communities, view them on a map, and observe co-location highlights within a dynamic graph implementation.
